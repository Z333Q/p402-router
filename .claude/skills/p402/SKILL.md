# P402: Payment-Aware AI Orchestration

P402.io is an infrastructure layer that solves two problems at once: fragmented AI provider APIs and broken micropayment economics. It routes LLM requests to the optimal provider based on cost, speed, or quality, while settling payments in USDC/USDT on Base blockchain using the x402 protocol.

The key mental model: P402 sits between your application and AI providers the same way a payment network sits between merchants and banks. It handles routing, authorization, and settlement so your code just makes API calls.

## Why P402 Exists

Traditional payment processors charge ~$0.30 per transaction, which makes micropayments for AI API calls (often $0.001-$0.05) economically impossible. P402 uses stablecoin settlement on Base L2 where transaction costs are fractions of a cent, enabling true pay-per-request economics for AI agents.

Most AI applications are "cost-blind" -- they hardcode a single provider and overpay by 70-85%. P402 makes applications "cost-aware" by exposing real-time pricing across 300+ models and routing intelligently.

## Core Concepts

### The Session Lifecycle

Sessions are the foundational primitive. Every interaction with P402 flows through a session:

1. **Create** a session with a budget cap and optional policies
2. **Fund** the session (USDC via Base Pay, direct transfer, or test credits)
3. **Use** the session for chat completions -- P402 tracks spending per request
4. **Expire** -- sessions auto-close when budget is exhausted or time limit is reached

Sessions enforce spending boundaries. An agent with a $10 session physically cannot spend $10.01. This is the core safety mechanism for autonomous agent spending.

### Routing Modes

Every chat completion request can specify a routing mode that controls how P402 selects the provider and model:

| Mode | Optimizes For | Best For | Typical Provider |
|------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| `cost` | Lowest price, acceptable quality | Batch processing, background tasks, high-volume | DeepSeek V3.2, Haiku 4.5, GPT-4o-mini |
| `quality` | Best output, price secondary | Final outputs, complex reasoning, user-facing answers | Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3.1 Pro |
| `speed` | Lowest latency, price secondary | Real-time chat, interactive UX, streaming | Groq (LPU), Flash models |
| `balanced` | Equal weight across all factors | General purpose, default choice | Sonnet 4.6, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 3.1 Pro |

The router scores every available model using a proprietary weighted algorithm, filters by capability requirements and policy constraints, and returns the optimal choice. If the selected provider fails, automatic failover retries with the next-best alternative.

**Decision guidance for developers:** Start with `balanced` as your default. Switch to `cost` for any task where quality above "good enough" does not matter (summarization, classification, extraction). Use `quality` only for tasks where the output is the final product a human will read or where reasoning depth is critical. Use `speed` when time-to-first-byte matters more than cost (real-time chat, autocomplete).

### The Billing Guard

P402 enforces a multi-layer defense system on every request. Default limits are configurable per tenant via the [P402 dashboard](https://p402.io/dashboard). Developers should handle these error codes:

| Layer | Protection | Error Code | What To Do |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Rate limit | Requests per hour cap | `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Back off, use `retryAfterMs` from error |
| Daily circuit breaker | Daily spend cap | `DAILY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Contact support or wait for daily reset |
| Concurrent requests | Simultaneous request cap | `TOO_MANY_CONCURRENT` | Queue requests, reduce parallelism |
| Anomaly detection | Statistical outlier detection | Logged warning (soft) | Unusual cost pattern flagged, not blocked |
| Per-request cap | Single request cost cap | `REQUEST_TOO_EXPENSIVE` | Use a cheaper model or reduce max_tokens |
| Budget reservation | Atomic budget check | Insufficient budget error | Fund the session with more USDC |

The guard runs a pre-check before every completion, executing all layers in sequence. If any hard layer fails, the request is rejected before it reaches the provider. This fail-closed design means an agent cannot spend money it has not been authorized to spend. View and adjust your limits at [p402.io/dashboard](https://p402.io/dashboard).

### The OpenAI-Compatible Interface

P402's chat completions endpoint is a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API. The only additions are the `p402` extension object and the `p402_metadata` in the response:

```typescript
// Before: direct OpenAI call
const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_KEY}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ model: 'gpt-4o', messages })
});

// After: P402 (same shape, smarter routing)
const response = await fetch('https://p402.io/api/v2/chat/completions', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${P402_KEY}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    messages,
    // model is optional -- P402 picks the best one
    p402: { mode: 'cost', session_id: 'sess_abc', cache: true }
  })
});
```

The response includes `p402_metadata` with the actual provider used, cost in USD, latency breakdown, and whether the response came from cache. Response headers also expose this: `X-P402-Provider`, `X-P402-Cost-USD`, `X-P402-Latency-MS`, `X-P402-Request-ID`.

### Semantic Cache

P402 can cache responses for semantically similar prompts. When enabled (`p402.cache: true`), the system:

1. Generates an embedding of the request via OpenRouter
2. Searches existing cache entries for high semantic similarity
3. Returns the cached response instantly if a strong match is found
4. Otherwise, forwards to the provider and caches the result

Caching is scoped by tenant -- no cross-tenant data leakage is possible. Default TTL is 1 hour, max age is 24 hours. Both are configurable per request via `p402.cache_ttl`. Tune cache settings in your [P402 dashboard](https://p402.io/dashboard).

Cache is most effective for: classification tasks, FAQ-style queries, repeated extractions, and any workload with natural prompt repetition. It is least effective for: creative generation, conversation continuations, and tasks requiring fresh data.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to try P402 is to sign in at [p402.io](https://p402.io) with your **email address** — no MetaMask or seed phrases required. A Base embedded wallet is created automatically via Coinbase CDP Embedded Wallet (email OTP, keys secured in AWS Nitro Enclave). The guided onboarding walks you through: role selection → API key generation → dashboard orientation. Wallet funding is pay-as-you-go — you'll be prompted to send USDC on Base when you make your first routed request.

For programmatic access, grab your API key from the dashboard after signing in. You can also try P402 via the **Base Mini App** at [mini.p402.io](https://mini.p402.io) — connect a Base Account, fund with USDC via Base Pay, and start chatting with real-time cost and savings tracking.

**MCP Server:** If you use Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf, add `@p402/mcp-server` to your MCP config — no REST integration needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "p402": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@p402/mcp-server"],
      "env": { "P402_API_KEY": "p402_live_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server is listed on the official registry as `io.github.Z333Q/p402`.

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Drop-In OpenAI Replacement (Simplest)

Change the base URL and API key. Optionally remove the `model` field to let P402 choose. Add `p402.mode` for routing control. This is a 2-line migration for any OpenAI SDK user.

### Pattern 2: Session-Budgeted Agent

Create a session with a dollar budget, pass `session_id` on every request, and P402 enforces the cap. When budget runs low, the session status changes to `exhausted` and requests are rejected. This is the pattern for autonomous agents that need spending guardrails.

### Pattern 3: A2A Agent-to-Agent Communication

Use the JSON-RPC endpoint at `/api/a2a` with Google's A2A protocol. Agents discover each other via `/.well-known/agent.json`, exchange tasks, and settle payments via the x402 extension. AP2 mandates pre-authorize spending. Read `references/a2a-protocol.md` for the full flow.

### Pattern 4: x402 Payment Settlement

For machine-to-machine payments using the HTTP 402 flow: service responds with payment requirements, client submits payment proof (EIP-3009 signature or transaction hash), service verifies and releases the resource. Three schemes are supported: `exact` (gasless EIP-3009), `onchain` (direct tx verification), and `receipt` (reuse prior payments). Read `references/payment-flows.md` for implementation details.

### Pattern 6: MCP Server (Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf)

Add `@p402/mcp-server` to your MCP client config. No REST integration needed — the server runs as a stdio subprocess and exposes all 6 tools natively. The client can call `p402_chat` to route and pay for LLM requests, `p402_create_session` to establish a budget, and `p402_list_models` to discover providers. Registry identifier: `io.github.Z333Q/p402`.

### Pattern 7: Cost Intelligence Dashboard

Use `/api/v2/analytics/spend` for spending data and `/api/v2/analytics/recommendations` for optimization suggestions. The recommendations endpoint identifies cheaper model alternatives and estimates potential savings. Use `/api/v2/providers/compare` to show users real-time pricing comparisons.
