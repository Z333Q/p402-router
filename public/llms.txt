# P402 - Payment Router for x402 Protocol

> P402 is a routing control plane for HTTP 402 payments. It enables developers to monetize APIs with stablecoins (USDC, USDT) on Base blockchain.

## What is P402?

P402 Router sits between paid endpoints and blockchain facilitators. It handles:
- Payment verification (trustless, on-chain)
- Policy enforcement (budgets, rate limits, spend caps)
- Multi-token support (USDC, USDT on Base Mainnet)
- Observability (traces, decision logs)

## SDK

Install: `npm install @p402/sdk`

```typescript
import { P402Client } from '@p402/sdk';
const client = new P402Client('https://p402.io');
await client.checkout({ amount: "10.00", asset: "USDC" }, signerCallback);
```
